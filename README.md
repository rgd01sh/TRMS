# Training Records Management System (TRMS)

## Project Overview

The **Training Records Management System (TRMS)** is a lightweight, web-based solution designed to help organizations efficiently manage and archive training data, including training sessions, certifications, and employee records. It simplifies the storage, retrieval, and reporting of key training information, making it easier for administrators to handle training department operations.

This system is designed to be a front-end only application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple solution that does not require back-end infrastructure.

## Features

- **File Management**: Upload, organize, and display training-related documents (e.g., certificates, slides, and reports).
- **Search and Filter**: Search for training records and filter by categories (e.g., training type, trainee names, and date).
- **Simple Spreadsheet Functionality**: Maintain and manage trainee records in a spreadsheet-like format, including export functionality to CSV.
- **Report & Certificate Generation**: Automatically generate training reports and certificates from the records.
- **Slide Generation**: Create customizable presentation slides summarizing training data and export them as PDFs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the system.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind interactions, file handling, data management, and report generation.
- **Libraries**:
  - **FileSaver.js**: For exporting files such as CSV and PDFs.
  - **html2pdf.js**: To convert HTML elements into downloadable PDFs.
  - **SheetJS (xlsx.js)**: For handling table data and generating spreadsheets.

## Installation

To set up and run the TRMS project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TRMS.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd TRMS
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   - You can simply double-click on `index.html` or right-click and select "Open with" your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Usage

Once the system is loaded in your browser, you can:

- **Upload files**: Use the file upload functionality to add training documents (certificates, slides, etc.).
- **Manage training records**: Add and edit training records directly in the spreadsheet-like table.
- **Generate reports**: Create and download training certificates and reports in PDF format.
- **Search and Filter**: Use the search and filter functionality to find specific records based on various criteria (e.g., trainee name, training type, date).

### Example Workflow:

1. Upload a certificate for a trainee.
2. Fill in the training record (e.g., trainee name, training type, completion date).
3. Use the **Search** bar to find specific training records.
4. Export the training data as a CSV for offline use.
5. Generate a certificate or report for a specific training session.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**: Add a backend (e.g., Node.js, Flask) for more robust file storage and user management.
2. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure sensitive data.
3. **Enhanced UI**: Develop a dashboard-style UI for better visualization and management of data.
4. **Analytics**: Add features like training completion statistics or certificate generation reports.
